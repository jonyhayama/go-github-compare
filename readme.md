# Go GitHub Compare

Compare GitHub repositories stats.

- This is a simple project designed to learn [ReactJS](https://nodejs.org).
- It's also a challenge proposed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br) on their [Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp).
- Use this project for **studying only** as it is not ready for production.

## The Challenge

We've created the biggest part of the app during the classes. The actual challenge was to:

- Store repositories list on `localStorage`
- Create a repositories `remove` button
- Create a repositories `refresh` button

You can read the challenge description (as well as chekout the teacher's code) [here](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-reactjs-desafio-02)

## Ideas TODO:

- Reload all repositories on page reload
- Give some user feedback when reloading repository (ie. make the refresh icon rotate)
- Inform user when reload fails (ie. make the refresh icon red)
- Add pretty icons for forks, starts, etc. (update font-awesome version)
